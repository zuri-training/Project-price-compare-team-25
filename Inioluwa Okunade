I contributed in meetings where the nature of the website and its functions were decided on.
I helped selecting colours and fonts.
I and two others were assigned the style guide. We created colour and font styles, iconography, colour styles, the input fields (with and without icons), componebts, grid and modals for both mobile and webview.
I created the Header and footer components for both lo-fi and hi-fi screens, the home-page hi-fi screen and the mobile screen for the error and contact us pages.
I assisted with the documentation for the first presentation.
I assisted with  reviewing the designed pages and worked on alignment and making sure the style guide was used.
