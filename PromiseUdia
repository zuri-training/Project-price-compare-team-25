-During the duration of the project, I was assigned to the research team, where we conducted the quantitative and qualitative researches to guide us on the design decision to be made when we design During the researchw we used google forms to get responses to various reasons why online shoppers compare prices before making a purchase and why they do so.
-I also joined the team in analysing the responses gotten from the survey and interview carried out and we compiled the Empathy map, user flow, pain points, user story, features listing and user persona  which served a our guide in the design phase. 
-In the design phase, I was assigned to create the design system alongside 2 teammates and together we came up with the typography, colour styles, iconography, buttton styles, input fields, components such as sliders for the hero section, modals, header and footers for the main design, we also worked on the grid system for the design frames (Web and Mobile) using the 8 point system. <a href ="https://www.figma.com/file/J4mwn9yjSAErf2s8OYLRXb/Price-Compare_Team-25"> Link to my assigned tasks</a>
