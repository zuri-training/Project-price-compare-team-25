During the duration of the project, I wass assigned to the research team, where we conducted the quantitative and qualitative researches to guide us on the design decision to be carried out. During the researchw we used google forms to get responses to various reasons why online shoppers compare prices before making a purchase and why they do so.
i also joined the team in analysing the responses gotten from the survey and interview carried out and we compiled the Empathy map, user flow, pain points, user story, features listing and user persona  which served a our guide in the design phase.
